# ⚡ GitHub Actions Guide

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) platform that allows you to **automate workflows** directly in your GitHub repository.

---

## 🚀 Key Concepts

- **Workflows**  
  Automated processes defined in YAML files inside `.github/workflows/`.

- **Events**  
  Triggers that start a workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`).

- **Jobs**  
  A set of steps that run on the same virtual machine (runner).

- **Steps**  
  Individual tasks that can run shell commands or use actions.

- **Actions**  
  Reusable units of code (created by you or shared by the community).

## 📂 Workflow File Structure

Workflows are stored in:

```

.github/
└── workflows/
└── ci.yml

````

## 📝 Example Workflow

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout repository code
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
````
